[this fix as it stands is a beta and the game is still being looked into so future updates will be posted so keep an eye out] 
(we are aware there is an issue with some clipping in game therefore as it stands we are still looking into FOV)

we have changed the resolution part of the menu so that only shows the width as there was an issue with it showing incorrectly in full.
