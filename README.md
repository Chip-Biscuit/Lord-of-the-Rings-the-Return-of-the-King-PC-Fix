# Requirements before using fix
For the Fix Enhancers fix to work properly **YOU MUST** download the amazing Nemesis2000 widescreen fix from here - http://ps2wide.net/lpc.html 

Once you download the Nemesis2000 fix place the LOTRW.dll and LOTR.ini into the games install folder next to the ROTK.exe file. **DO NOT PLACE THE** d3d8.dll file from Nemesis2000 fix into the game install area as this is replaced by the Fix Enhancers d3d8.dll file instead.

The Nemesis2000 fix will cover the resolution and aspect ratio side while the Fix Enhancers fix covers everything else.

# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest lotrRotkfix.zip file, extract it and put the d3d8.dll and d3d8.ini into your game folder next to the ROTK.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d8.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
Open the LOTR.ini file and next to Width and Hight put your resolution for example (3840x2160). Not that once you boot up the game it will now be set to the correct resolution and aspect ratio. However, **DO NOT** change the resolution in the games graphics options and the resolution you put in the LOTR.ini file will not show up in the resolution list within the game which is normal.

# FPS
The default for FPS is (60) you can change it as you wish or fully uncap it with (0) with the FPSLimit option in the d3d8.ini file. The FPS has been limited to 120fps in this fix due to game breaking bugs going above 120fps.

# FOV
The default for FOV is (0) which is off, you can turn this on in the d3d8.ini by changing the (0) to (1). 

It is recommended that this is kept off by default due to FOV being quite broken in multiple areas of the game such as the level selection menu. You can use this setting, and it will be mostly ok during gameplay and will fix issues on higher resolutions where the camera goes inside the characters during cutscenes.
